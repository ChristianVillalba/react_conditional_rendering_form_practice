## Description

A form that will render inputs depending on if the user is registered:

- If the user is registered:
  - Username
  - Password
  - Login (Button)
- If the user is NOT registered:
  - Username
  - Password
  - Confirm Password
  - Register (Button)

## What I have learned with this project:

- Use components and props.
- Render componenets depeding of certain condition (if statement).
- Use TERNARY OPERATOR.
